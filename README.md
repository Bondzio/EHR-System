# EHR-System

EHR system for all hospitals in Egypt Introduction: So as we know that the Egyptian community is kind of lazy and hate to hold things on his hands and they may also lose his things but the biggest fear is that they may lose their conscious or they might have a medical issue and no one could know about it. so our idea is based on that fear as we believe that the Egyptian citizen should feel safe and must see that there’s someone who cares about him and his health so after we did our researches we found out that there’s no one in the whole country did provide a good service to Egyptians and we feel that we have a good opportunity to achieve something -even if it is small –to the community.
